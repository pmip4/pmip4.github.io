## Welcome to the PMIP4 code repository

This organisation collects together the various pieces of code that have been contributed and deal with PMIP4 simulations in analyses. It is a place to enable scripts to be shared and found with fellow researchers. 

The codes here range from a single python script creating a single figure to large analysis packages that are aimed to be run on many different simulations at once. One or two of them may even come as Docker images that allow analyses to be performed within a platform-agnostic container. 

If you would like to volunteer your own piece of code, please contact Chris to be added to this organisation. 

The repos currently stored here are:
1. **[PMIP_resolution_improvements](https://github.com/pmip4/PMIP_resolution_improvements)** creates a plot showing the changes in resolution over all 4 generations of PMIP (Chris Brierley)
